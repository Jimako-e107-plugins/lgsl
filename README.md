Original author of LGSL - Richard Perry (www.greycube.com)

Actual author of LGSL - tltneon 

Thanks Asger from https://urbangamers.dk/ for testing data and advices to be able create version for LGSL  5.10.3

Thanks TacTicTow  for testing version for LGSL 6.2.0

I am not a player, so this is unknown territory for me. 
 


##e107 functionality:

- install LGSL via e107 plugin manager

- include admin interface of LGSL inside e107 admin area - available for admins with access to this plugin

- all configuration is done in Settings option (no need to change anything in lgsl_config file) - available only for main admins

- LSGL part is fully manager by LGSL script, only different file is lgsl_config.php

- unlimited zones and unlimites menu areas


### Limitation

You can't use e107 inside original files because file userbar.php (generating userbar), so SEF-URL is not possible for detail page. For now.
